I may be biased, but being a web developer is a great career choice. Being able to make a good living out of it depends on your ability to promote yourself to potential clients or employers. It all starts with choosing the right web hosting.

If you're in a hurry, here are my top recommendations:
- **Easiest to use**: Cloudways ([get started with a 3-day free trial](https://benjamincrozat.com/recommends/cloudways))
- **Best UX and good prices**: Vultr ([get started with $100 of credit](https://benjamincrozat.com/recommends/vultr))
- DigitalOcean ([get started with $200 of credit](https://benjamincrozat.com/recommends/digitalocean))

Keep reading for more details about each web hosting.

# 2022 SEO case study: programming niche (+660% increase)

![Illustration of a rocket.](https://res.cloudinary.com/benjamin-crozat/image/upload/dpr_auto,f_auto,q_auto,w_auto/v1666719094/benjamincrozat.com/rocket_xv9mlh.png)

Here's a case study example for my blog benjamincrozat.com. As you may have seen, it's a blog about programming with web technologies.

Since I started it in September 2022, **clicks on Google increased by 660%**.

I'm doing web development for a living, not SEO. But I'm a fast learner and I like to learn by doing. In this article, you'll learn about everything I did to rank my blog as high as possible in as many keywords as possible.

## I don't wait for Google to crawl my site

The Google Search Console is an extremely valuable tool. You can get all sorts of valuable data about how your site is doing in search results.

But did you know you can actually "force" Google to crawl your site as soon as you published new content?

In the search field at the top of the console, enter any new or updated URL, and Google will (most of the time) crawl it and update its index in a matter of hours. 

## My technical SEO is top-notch

As a web developer, I have the luxury to not have to use WordPress or any other platform.

My blog lays on a a completely custom platform I coded from A to Z. (Excluding open-source components I use like everyone else.)

Therefore, I can guarantee maximum scores on various benchmarks (Ahrefs, Lighthouse, etc.), because I know everything that's going on under the hood.

## I wrote a few articles and I update them constantly

I'm not convinced you need to spam Google with dozens of new articles every month to rank (in the beginning at least).

For now, I have ~15 articles and that's perfectly fine.

I update them regularly, based on what competitors are doing. I also structure them to be as snippets-friendly as possible, which can help you reach the first position in the SERPs more quickly.

## I built a few links

Link building isn't most people's cup of tea. Myself included. But it needs to be done. I build links by:
- Writing guest posts (for now, I only wrote one, which isn't enough);
- Posting community links on various websites (used in newsletters for instance);
- I also tried to post dofollow links on forums, but I now know **it doesn't work unless it's relevant to the conversation**. **You can be penalized for that**. Remove them if you can.

I even naturally acquired some links from high authorities in the niche (on [Laravel.io](https://laravel.io), [Freek Van der Herten's blog](https://freek.dev) and [Larachat](https://larachat.co) for example).

## Reports for each month since the beginning

### October 2022

October 2022 is not done yet, but I want to share the data anyway.

The numbers:

- Clicks: **304**;
- Impressions: **20.4K**;
- Average CTR: **1.5%**;
- Average position: **27.5**.

What I did:

- I wrote new articles based on keyword research;
- I updated articles based on what the competition is doing and when I felt I could structure them better;
- I naturally got very high-quality backlinks from authorities in this niche by writing about emerging topics way ahead of anyone.

### September 2022

The numbers:

- Clicks: **46**;
- Impressions: **5.14K**;
- Average CTR: **0.9%**;
- Average position: **42.7**.

What I did:

- I set up a new site on a 7 years old domain that was never used for anything good;
- I wrote a few articles based on keyword research;
- I constantly updated all those articles whenever I noticed their structure could be improved, as well as various kind of mistakes (such as grammar);
- I tried to build a few links on relevant websites (community links essentially).

# 2022 SEO case study: programming niche (+710% increase)

![Illustration of a rocket.](https://res.cloudinary.com/benjamin-crozat/image/upload/dpr_auto,f_auto,q_auto,w_auto/v1666719094/benjamincrozat.com/rocket_xv9mlh.png)

Here's a case study example for benjamincrozat.com, a blog about programming.

Since I started it in September 2022, **clicks on Google increased by 710%**.

I'm doing web development for a living, not SEO. But I'm a fast learner and I like to learn by doing. In this article, you'll learn about everything I did to rank my blog as high as possible in as many keywords as possible.

## I don't wait for Google to crawl my site

The [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console) is an extremely valuable tool. You can get all sorts of valuable data about how your site is doing in the SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages).

But did you know you can actually "force" Google to crawl your site as soon as you published new content?

In the search field at the top of the console, enter any new or updated URL, and Google will (most of the time) crawl it and update its index in a matter of hours.

## My technical SEO is top-notch

As a web developer, I have the luxury to not have to use WordPress or any other platform.

My blog lays on a completely custom platform I coded from A to Z. (Excluding open-source components I use like everyone else.)

Therefore, I can guarantee maximum scores on various benchmarks (Ahrefs, Lighthouse, etc.), because I know everything that's going on under the hood.

But if you're using something like WordPress, I would just recommend to be careful when choosing themes and plugins, as most of them are low quality and can significantly impact the performances of your site.

## I wrote a few articles and I update them constantly

I'm not convinced you need to spam Google with dozens of new articles every month to rank (in the beginning at least).

For now, I have more than 15 articles that I wrote based on popular keywords and that's perfectly fine.

I update them regularly, based on what competitors are doing (competitors are sites that are near me in the SERPs). 

I also structure them to be as snippets-friendly as possible, which can help you rank first quicker.

## I built a few links

Link building isn't most people's cup of tea. Myself included. But it needs to be done.

I essentially build links posting community links on various popular websites in the niche (these links are also reused in newsletter, which is an additional channel of traffic);

I also tried to post dofollow links on forums, but I now know **it doesn't work unless it's relevant to the conversation**. **You can get penalized for that**. Remove them ASAP if you can.

I even naturally acquired some links from high authorities in the niche (on [Laravel.io](https://laravel.io), [Freek Van der Herten's blog](https://freek.dev) and [Larachat](https://larachat.co) for example).

## Reports for each month since the beginning

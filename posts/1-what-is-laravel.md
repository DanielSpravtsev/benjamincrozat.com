# What is Laravel? A complete and simplified explanation.

As a web developer, Laravel changed my life. It made me better at building web applications, taking complete control over them, and stepping up my freelance game to the point that I'm blogging about it. Here are all your answers about Laravel, without going too deep into technical details.

## What is Laravel?

[Laravel](https://laravel.com) is a web framework that gives developers many pre-built features and guidelines for writing and organizing code. Taylor Otwell created Laravel back in 2011 as a more advanced alternative to [CodeIgniter](https://codeigniter.com), another open-source PHP framework.

## Is Laravel frontend or backend?

Laravel is a full-stack framework. Yes, it is a backend development framework, but it also manages the frontend of your web applications.

## Are PHP and Laravel the same?

PHP is a server-side scripting language. Laravel is a tool made with PHP.

## Are there alternative PHP frameworks? 

Yes, there are. Here is a list of the best alternative PHP web frameworks: [Symfony](https://symfony.com), [CodeIgniter](https://codeigniter.com), [CakePHP](https://cakephp.org), etc.  
Whichever you choose doesn't matter. They all have their pros and cons, and only what you make with them truly matters.

## What is the most used PHP framework?

In 2022, the Laravel framework is the most used PHP framework, way ahead of Symfony. Laravel developers should have pretty good job security for years to come.

But that's not it. Thanks to Composer and Laravel's modular package system, the community provides a huge amount of packages for you to use free of charge (find them on [Packagist](https://packagist.org)). Laravel also proposes official packages:

Let me talk about some of those Laravel packages that I think are remarquable.

[Laravel Cashier](https://laravel.com/docs/billing) is an abstraction over Stripe's API (meaning that you don't have to deal with their RESTful API).

### What is Laravel Horizon?

### What is Laravel Octane?

[Laravel Octane](https://laravel.com/docs/octane) is a powerful tool that speeds up any website by keeping the bootstrapping process of Laravel in memory. Only your code will be run every time a visitor goes onto your website. If you have a very high-traffic website, your servers will thank you.

### What is Laravel Sanctum?

## How much does Laravel cost?

Laravel costs nothing. It is an open-source project that anybody can use to create any web application. Developers can even contribute to the code of Laravel itself. Here is [the official repository of Laravel on GitHub](https://laravel.com/laravel/laravel).

## Is Laravel easy to learn for beginners?

As long as you already have experience in web development, especially with PHP (PHP is an object-oriented scripting language) you shouldn't have much trouble learning Laravel.

## How to learn Laravel?

The Laravel community is highly active and releases plenty of free and paid Laravel tutorials.

The best way to start learning, apart from [the official Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs), is [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com), which proposes plenty of free videos to help you get started.

Here is a list of other resources you might also like:

- [Laravel Daily on YouTube by Povilas Korop](https://www.youtube.com/c/LaravelDaily). You'll never face a shortage of content on his channel;

- [Christophe Rumpel, also on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/christophrumpel);

- [Laravel Online](https://www.youtube.com/c/LaraconOnline/videos) and [Laracon EU](https://www.youtube.com/c/LaraconEU). Speakers talk about Laravel, its ecosystem, and their real-life experiences as web developers.;

- [Laravel News](https://laravel-news.com). If you want to be the most knowledgeable about Laravel, this is where you want to go.

## How long to learn Laravel?

Depending on your abilities and willingness to master it, learning Laravel can either take months or years. How are you familiar with programming? How long have you been a developer? Is Laravel forced on you at school?

Also, do you prefer text content or videos? There are so many variables that it's impossible to give you an estimation.

I have bits of advice for you:

- Contribute to open-source projects. It's one of the most efficient ways to learn. You will also learn how to work with other developers on the same codebase;

- Start an actual project based on Laravel; this will also be a great source of learning;

- But most importantly, **don't give up**. It doesn't matter how much time it takes. **Laravel is a good investment**.

## What is the latest Laravel version?

The latest Laravel version is version 9\. It was released on February 8th, 2022.

## How to host a Laravel application?

My main recommendation for hosting a Laravel application would be [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/58bbdf89fc72). I've been using it for years, as well as many developers, and it never failed me. Scale up your VPC (Virtual Private Server) whenever you need to handle more traffic, and scale it back down when your traffic goes back to normal.

Even better: you can [get $100 of credit for 60 days](https://m.do.co/c/58bbdf89fc72) to try it!

Once you get your hosting, I highly recommend using [Laravel Forge](https://forge.laravel.com), which plugs into DigitalOcean and sets up your server for you while also making it super optimized for running Laravel applications.

Or, if you want automated scalability, you may want to try [Laravel Vapor](https://vapor.laravel.com), a serverless deployment platform for Laravel applications that uses Amazon Web Services.

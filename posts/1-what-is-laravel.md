# What's Laravel? A complete & simplified explanation for 2022.

As a web developer, Laravel changed my life.

It made me better at building web applications, taking complete control over them, and stepping up my freelance game to the point that I'm blogging about it.

Here are all the answers you were looking for about Laravel, without going too deep into technical details.

## What is Laravel?

[Laravel](https://laravel.com) is a web framework that gives developers many pre-built features and guidelines for writing and organizing code. Taylor Otwell created Laravel back in 2011 as a more advanced alternative to [CodeIgniter](https://codeigniter.com), another open-source PHP framework.

## Is Laravel frontend or backend?

Laravel is a full-stack framework. Yes, it is a backend development framework, but it also manages the frontend of your web applications.

## Are PHP and Laravel the same?

PHP is a server-side scripting language. Laravel is a tool made with PHP.

Whichever you choose doesn't matter. They all have their pros and cons, and only what you make with them truly matters.

## How much does Laravel cost?

**Laravel costs nothing.** It's an open-source project anybody can use to create web applications. Developers can even contribute to its source code. Here is the official [repository](https://laravel.com/laravel/laravel).

## Is Laravel easy to learn for beginners?

As long as you already have experience in web development, especially with PHP (PHP is an object-oriented scripting language) you shouldn't have much trouble learning Laravel.

## Can I learn Laravel without PHP?

Laravel is built with PHP. You have to know PHP to use Laravel. This is the way.

## How to learn Laravel?

The Laravel community is highly active and releases plenty of free and paid Laravel tutorials.

The best way to start learning, apart from [the official Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs), is [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com), which proposes plenty of free videos to help you get started.

Here is a list of other resources you might also like:

- [Laravel Daily on YouTube by Povilas Korop](https://www.youtube.com/c/LaravelDaily). You'll never face a shortage of content on his channel;

- [Christophe Rumpel, also on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/christophrumpel);

- [Laravel Online](https://www.youtube.com/c/LaraconOnline/videos) and [Laracon EU](https://www.youtube.com/c/LaraconEU). Speakers talk about Laravel, its ecosystem, and their real-life experiences as web developers.;

- [Laravel News](https://laravel-news.com). If you want to be the most knowledgeable about Laravel, this is where you want to go.

## How long to learn Laravel?

Depending on your abilities and willingness to master it, learning Laravel can either take months or years. How are you familiar with programming? How long have you been a developer? Is Laravel forced on you at school?

Also, do you prefer text content or videos? There are so many variables that it's impossible to give you an estimation.

I have bits of advice for you:

- Contribute to open-source projects. It's one of the most efficient ways to learn. You will also learn how to work with other developers on the same codebase;
- Start an actual project based on Laravel; this will also be a great source of learning;
- But most importantly, **don't give up**. It doesn't matter how much time it takes. **Laravel is a good investment**.

# The 5 best PHP & Laravel blogs to read in 2022

I wouldn‚Äôt be where I am today without other developers sharing their knowledge through blogging.

Therefore, I present you a bunch of awesome PHP blogs from community members publishing interesting and valuable content. Get your RSS feeds aggregator and follow me!

(I will update this article each time I find a new PHP blog worth reading.)

Brent Roose is also a well known PHP developer in the Laravel community. But he writes more about PHP itself than Laravel. He was working at Spatie for a few years before taking a new position at JetBrains, which is responsible for PHPStorm's development.

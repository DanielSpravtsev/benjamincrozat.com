# Best PHP blogs to read in 2022

I think blogging is necessary. I wouldnâ€™t be where I am today without others sharing their knowledge. Everybody owning their content should be the default. Therefore, I present you a bunch of awesome PHP blogs from community members publishing interesting and valuable content. Get your RSS feeds aggregator and follow me!

I will update this article as soon as I find any new PHP blog worth reading.

## [Christoph Rumpel's blog](https://christoph-rumpel.com)

Christoph Rumpel is an active member of the Laravel community. If you're a Laravel user, you might want to check out all the useful tips he shares on his blog. Recently he was one of the [Laracon Online's pre-party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Bzb5fsn4Jo).

Freek Van der Herten is a well known PHP developer in the Laravel community. He is one of [Spatie](https://spatie.be)'s co-founders, which authored a massive amount of Laravel packages to help developers get shit done quicker.

## [Matthias Noback's blog](https://matthiasnoback.nl/archives/)

This one is a PHP blog I recently discovered. I don't know much about this developer and I think his articles are very interesting.

Brent Roose is also a well known PHP developer in the Laravel community. But he writes more about PHP itself than Laravel. He was working at Spatie for a few years before taking a new position at JetBrains, which is responsible for PHPStorm's development.

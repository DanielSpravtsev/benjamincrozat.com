# Learn all about the switch statement in PHP

## What is a switch statement in PHP?

**The `switch` statement is similar to a `if` statement, but it is less repetitive and less prone to errors.**

It should be used when you have to check a decent amounf of values. Let me explain.

## Why use switch instead of if in PHP?

Sometimes, you may have to compare a variable or an expression to a significant amount of possible values. Doing it with an `if` statement can be repetitive and harder to read.

In the following example, a `$language` variable has been declared, and we display a thank you depending on its value. Here's how it looks with an `if`:

```php
$language = 'Fran√ßais';

if ($language === 'English') {
    echo 'Thank you!';
} elseif ($language === 'Espa√±ol') {
    echo '¬°Gracias!';
} elseif ($language === 'Fran√ßais') {
    echo 'Merci !';
} elseif ($language === 'Italiano') {
    echo 'Grazie!';
} else {
    echo 'ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è';
}
```

Let's now see how it looks with a `switch`.

## How does the switch statement works in PHP?

Apart from the `break` statement, `switch`'s syntax is less repetitive and easier to read.

```php
$language = 'Fran√ßais';

switch ($language) {
	case 'English':
		echo 'Thank you!';
		break;
	case 'Espa√±ol':
		echo '¬°Gracias!';
		break;
	case 'Fran√ßais':
		echo 'Merci !';
		break;
	case 'Italiano':
		echo 'Grazie!';
	    break;
    default:
		echo 'ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è';
}
```

1. Each `case` is run in the order it's been declared;
2. If the condition is met (in this example, `$language` equals "Fran√ßais"), we run the code following the `case` statement;
4. If the `break` statement isn't used, each case will be executed after a match. Don't forget to use it!
3. The `default` case comes last and it has to be unique to avoid a fatal error.

# The best GDPR-compliant Google Analytics alternatives in 2022

![GDPR compliance](https://res.cloudinary.com/benjamin-crozat/image/upload/dpr_auto,f_auto,q_auto,w_auto/v1667409628/data-security_z5tsl9.jpg)

Google Analytics is a fine tool for tracking your traffic. That said it's kind of clunky, even in its 4th version. It also gets blocked by all ad blockers, which is a deal breaker for most of us. 
But that's not it: the biggest issue for many businesses is its total lack of GDPR compliance. 
First, here's my listing of the best alternatives, and then I'll explain why you should care about GDPR compliance.

- **Best overall**: Fathom Analytics ([get started with a 7-day trial and $10 discount on your first invoice](https://benjamincrozat.com/recommends/fathom-analytics))
- Well, that's it for now. ðŸ˜…

**Currently researching more alternatives. I will update this article as soon as I find a compelling new solution. Nothing so far.**

## What is GDPR?

GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation. It's a European Union regulation that came into effect in 2018. It's designed to protect the privacy of EU citizens and give them more control over their data.

## Here's why you should be concerned about GDPR

Government fines for non-compliance can be up to **â‚¬10 million, or 2% of your previous annual revenue**. That's potentially a lot of money that goes to waste.

Fathom Analytics is a privacy-first analytics tool that doesn't track your users. It's a dead simple, lightweight, and fast alternative to Google Analytics. Of course, it's also GDPR compliant and doesn't use cookies, **which could make you avoid a huge government fine**.

What I love about Fathom compared to Google Analytics is that it's easy to get the information you need. For instance, you may want to see how much visitors you acquired from Google in the past month. With Google Analytics, you have to go through a lot of steps to get that information. With Fathom, it's on the Dashboard and two clicks away.

Did you know that **Fathom is what this website uses to track its visitors**? I can't recommend this service enough!

The **pros** of Fathom Analytics:
- Dark mode!
- Doesn't use cookies
- Export data to CSV
- Extremely fast script
- Simple user interface
- Unlimited data retention
- Use a custom domain to avoid being blocked by ad blockers
- Events tracking to anonymously monitor how people use your website
- EU traffic is automatically routed through European-owned infrastructure
- Simple, free, and reactive uptime monitoring that sends you an email or SMS
- Used by thousands of businesses, including some we love, like Laravel, GitHub (Microsoft), Tailwind CSS, Vue.js, IBM, and more

The **cons** of Fathom Analytics:
- The dashboard's UI could be better;
- I noticed some bugs when you have too much filters in place.

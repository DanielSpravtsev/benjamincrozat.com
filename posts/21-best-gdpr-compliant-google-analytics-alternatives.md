# The best GDPR-compliant Google Analytics alternatives in 2022

![GDPR compliance](https://res.cloudinary.com/benjamin-crozat/image/upload/dpr_auto,f_auto,q_auto,w_auto/v1667409628/data-security_z5tsl9.jpg)

Google Analytics is a fine tool for tracking your traffic. That said it's kind of clunky, even with its 4th version. It gets blocked by all ad blockers, which is a deal breaker for most of us. 
But that's not it: the biggest issue for many businesses is its total lack of GDPR compliance. 
First, here's my listing of the best alternatives, and then I'll explain why you should care about GDPR compliance.

- **Best overall**: Fathom Analytics ([get started with a 7-day trial and $10 discount on your first invoice](https://benjamincrozat.com/recommends/fathom-analytics))
- Well, that's it for now. ðŸ˜…

**Currently researching more alternatives. I will update this article as soon as I find a compelling new solution. Nothing so far.**

## What is GDPR?

GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation. It's a European Union regulation that came into effect in 2018. It's designed to protect the privacy of EU citizens and give them more control over their data.

## Here's why you should be concerned about GDPR

Government fines for non-compliance can be up to **â‚¬10 million, or 2% of your previous annual revenue**. That's potentially a lot of money that goes to waste.

Fathom Analytics is a privacy-first analytics tool that doesn't track your users. It's a dead simple, lightweight, and fast alternative to Google Analytics. Of course, it's also GDPR compliant and doesn't use cookies, **which could make you avoid a huge government fine**.

Actually, **Fathom is what this website uses to track its visitors**. I can't recommend this service enough!

Key features:
- Dark mode!
- Export data to CSV
- Extremely fast script
- Simple user interface
- Unlimited data retention
- Use a custom domain to avoid being blocked by ad blockers
- Events tracking to anonymously monitor how people use your website
- EU traffic is automatically routed through European-owned infrastructure
- Simple, free, and reactive uptime monitoring that sends you an email or SMS
- Used by thousands of businesses, including some we love, like Laravel, GitHub (Microsoft), TailwindCSS, Vue.js, IBM, and more

## What is Laravel Forge?

[Laravel Forge](https://forge.laravel.com) is a platform for provisioning, managing, and deploying PHP applications (whether they're based on Laravel or not).

I started using it many years ago and I can't live without it anymore.

It offers a convenient way to create and manage web applications on your favorite web hosting provider.

Laravel Forge was created by Taylor Otwell, the creator of Laravel. It is a paid service with a **free trial**.

Features:
- Push To Deploy;
- Free TLS Certificates with Let's Encrypt;
- Easy setup of queues;
- Database backups;
- Task scheduling;
- Log files access;
- And **much more**!

## The kind of web hosting you need for Laravel Forge

In order for Laravel Forge to provision and manage your servers, you need to have full power over it.

**Get an hosting with SSH and admin access.** Therefore, shared hostings don't work.

Prefer a VPS (Virtual Private Server) or a dedicated machine.

# What's new in PHP 8.3? Take a sneak peek.

PHP is an open-source project. Knowing what's up for the next release only takes a minute of research. This page lists all the [accepted RFCs](https://wiki.php.net/rfc).

## When will PHP 8.3 be released?

According to the [official website](https://wiki.php.net/todo/php83), **PHP 8.3 will be released on November 23, 2023**, after three alpha releases, three beta, and six release candidates. 

## json_validate()

Instead of using `json_decode()` to validate a JSON string, you can now use `json_validate()`. According to its [RFC](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/json_validate), it also consumes fewer resources.

```php
json_validate('{ "foo": "bar", }');

// Syntax error
echo json_last_error_msg();
```

As you can see, `json_validate()` returns a `boolean`, and you can fetch the error message with `json_last_error()` or `json_last_error_msg()` for more details.

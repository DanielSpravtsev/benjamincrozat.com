# 2022 SEO case study: programming niche (+750% increase)

![Illustration of a rocket.](https://res.cloudinary.com/benjamin-crozat/image/upload/dpr_auto,f_auto,q_auto,w_auto/v1666719094/benjamincrozat.com/rocket_xv9mlh.png)

Here's a case study example for [benjamincrozat.com](https://benjamincrozat.com), my blog about programming with PHP and Laravel.

Since I started in September 2022, **clicks on Google increased by 750%**.

I'm doing web development for a living, not SEO. But I'm a fast learner and like to learn by doing. In this article, you'll also learn about everything I did to rank my blog as high as possible with many keywords.

## Why should you care about SEO?

For me, traffic is like money; it should be passive.

I don't want to work my ass off for brief traffic spikes because I went viral on social media. 

Therefore, I write blog posts based on what people are searching for, and slowly but surely, traffic comes, grows, and stays.

## What to do to get more traffic from search engines

### Don't wait for Google to crawl your site

The [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console) is a precious tool. You can get valuable data about how your site is doing in the SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages).

But did you know you can actually "force" Google to crawl your site as soon as you publish new content?

In the search field at the top of the console, enter any new or updated URL, and Google will (most of the time) crawl it and update its index in a matter of hours.

[This practice is well documented by Google](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/ask-google-to-recrawl).

### Your technical SEO should be good enough

As a web developer, I have the luxury of not having to use WordPress or any other platform.

My blog lays on a completely custom platform I coded from A to Z. (Excluding open-source components I use like everyone else.)

Therefore, I can guarantee maximum scores on various benchmarks (Ahrefs, Lighthouse, etc.), because I know everything that's going on under the hood.

If you're using something like WordPress, I recommend being careful when choosing themes and plugins, as most are low quality and can significantly impact your site's performance and, therefore, your rankings.

Stay calm, though. Google doesn't require perfection. It cares about:
- Performances (your site should load under 2 seconds);
- Mobile-friendly-ness;
- HTTPS;
- Good usability.

### You should do keyword research

Keyword research is the process of finding words and phrases that people use when searching for information on the internet.

By doing it, you can learn what people are looking for and how to make your website more visible to them.

To do keyword research, you can use free means like Google's autocomplete suggestions, people also ask on the SERPs, etc. Google AdWords keyword planner also works. üëç

Once you have a list of keywords, you can start writing blog posts around them. This will help your website show up more often in search results, and ultimately, get more traffic without lifting a finger.

### Write a bunch of articles and update them regularly

I'm not convinced you need to spam Google with dozens of new articles every month to rank (in the beginning, at least).

For now, I have more than 15 articles that I wrote based on popular keywords, and that's perfectly fine.

I update them regularly based on what competitors are doing (competitors are sites near me in the SERPs). 

I also structure them to be as snippets-friendly as possible (imagine a dumb bot parsing your content), which can help you rank first quicker. [The official documentation for snippets](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/page-experience#signals) is vague, unfortunately.

### Build backlinks

Link building isn't most people's cup of tea. Myself included. But it needs to be done, because **it's one of the most critical ranking factors**.

I essentially build them by posting community links on various popular websites in the niche (these links are also reused in newsletters, which is an additional channel of traffic);

I also tried to post dofollow links on forums, but I now know **it doesn't work unless it's relevant to the conversation**. **You can get penalized for that**. Remove them ASAP if you can.

I even naturally acquired some links from high authorities in the niche (on [Laravel.io](https://laravel.io), [Freek Van der Herten's blog](https://freek.dev) and [Larachat](https://larachat.co) for example).

## Reports for each month since the beginning

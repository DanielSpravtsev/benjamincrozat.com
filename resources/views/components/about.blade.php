<p>Hi! I'm Benjamin Crozat. I'm from the South of France and <strong>I've been a self-taught professional web developer for more than 10 years</strong>.</p>

<p>Coming from a modest family, <strong>being able to educate myself for free on the web changed my life for the better</strong>. Giving back to the community was a natural direction in my career.</p>

<p>Therefore, I decided to take action to increase my reach:</p>

<ol>
    <li>I launched this blog in September 2022 with the goal to be in everyone's Google search. <strong>I get more than 15,000 monthly clicks from it and more than 30,000 visits overall</strong> (<a href="https://benjamincrozat.pirsch.io/?domain=benjamincrozat.com&interval=30d&scale=day" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">my analytics dashboard is public</a> by the way).</li>
    <li>I also started growing my <a href="https://x.com/benjamincrozat" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">X (formerly Twitter)</a> account at the same time, which has now <strong>over 4,000 followers</strong>.</li>
    <li>Jeffrey Way reached out and offered me to write for the <a href="https://laracasts.com/blog" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">blog of Laracasts</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Believe me, I'm just getting started and many other cool things are on the way!</p>
